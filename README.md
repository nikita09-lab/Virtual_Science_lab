## 📖 Overview

**Virtual Science Lab Simulator** is an interactive, high-fidelity web application designed to empower students to conduct scientific experiments in a safe, cost-effective, and fully digital environment. 

By providing highly visual 3D model simulations, the platform enables students to explore:
* 🧬 **Biology**: Interactive anatomy, mitochondria cells, renal structures, and human sensory organs.
* 🧪 **Chemistry**: Practical equipment layouts, chemical titration, condensers, and neutralization reactions.
* ⚡ **Physics**: Electromagnetic fields, Fleming's right-hand rule, and kinematic velocity & acceleration models.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎮 Interactive 3D Simulations
* **High-Fidelity Models**: Explore detailed 3D scientific structures directly in the browser using Sketchfab WebGL models.
* **Guided Instructions**: Follow structured pedagogical guides featuring precise Aims, Theories, Procedures, and Safety Precautions.

### 📝 Smart Notes & observations
* **Autosave Notes**: Record observations, draft conclusions, and document key takeaways in real-time.
* **Universal Exporters**: Download study logs instantly as formatted Plain Text (`.txt`), Markdown (`.md`), or compile local PDF reports.

### 🏆 Gamification & Post-Lab Quizzes
* **Interactive Evaluations**: Test comprehension with post-experiment quizzes complete with immediate explanations.
* **Milestone Achievements**: Earn Experience Points (XP) and unlock professional subject-themed badges (e.g., *Junior Biologist*, *Physics Pro*) based on test performance.

## 🔌 Offline Mode & PWA Capabilities

To ensure accessibility in remote, low-network, or unstable internet environments, the platform functions as an installable **Progressive Web App (PWA)** equipped with complete local data persistence:

1. **Asset Caching**: Leverages a robust Service Worker (`sw.js`) to cache the application shell, layout modules, and static assets, providing instant loads offline.
2. **Local Persistence (IndexedDB)**: Integrates a local database wrapper (`offlineDb`) to capture and save:
   * Experiment completion records and recommendation history.
   * Student observations and autosaved lab notes.
   * Full quiz attempts, completed scores, and badge unlocks.
3. **Simulated Gamification Playback**: Quizzes are fully playable offline. XP gains and badge conditions are calculated entirely on the client, giving students immediate positive feedback.
4. **Outbox Synchronization**: Unsynced updates are queued as actions inside an IndexedDB outbox. The background `<SyncManager />` automatically batch-syncs these actions to the `/api/sync` backend API as soon as connection is restored, resolving conflicts using timestamp-based Last-Write-Wins (LWW) logic.
5. **Visual Fallbacks**: External Sketchfab WebGL iframes gracefully degrade offline to a premium glassmorphic visual card, while keeping static lessons, local notes, and quizzes accessible.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
* **Core Framework**: React 19 (JSX) & React Router v7 (Client-side routing)
* **Styling & UI**: Tailwind CSS (Utility styling) & Framer Motion (Smooth layout transitions)
* **Local Persistence**: Browser IndexedDB (`offlineDb` schema) & LocalStorage (App settings)
* **Offline Caching**: Vanilla Service Worker (`sw.js` fetch interceptor)

### Backend
* **Core Engine**: Python & FastAPI (High-performance API endpoints)
* **Object Mapping**: Pydantic v2 (Input schemas & responses)

### Database & Deployments
* **Primary Storage**: MongoDB (Append-only quiz attempts, notes tables, user gamification progress)
* **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend client) & Render (Backend API services)
